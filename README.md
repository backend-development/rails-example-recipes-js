a ruby on rails 5.0 example app
to learn about the asset pipeline.

clone this repository, then

    bundle
    rails db:migrate
    rails server

* configure the app to use EcmaScript 6 (ES6)
* write your own nobstrusive javascript that calls a ES6 class
* Use AJAX to create and "inline editing form"
